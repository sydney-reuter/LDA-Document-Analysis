This project was created by Sydney Reuter as part of the George Mason University (GMU) CRIM 515 class, Criminal Justice Research Methods and Data Analysis. The project analyzes 98 research articles authored by members of GMU's Criminology, Law and Society (CLS) program. The primary statistical method used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a machine learning technique, which identifies common topics and themes. Visual outputs include bar charts and word maps, which were visually analyzed to confirm the LDA findings and identify relationships between common topics.
