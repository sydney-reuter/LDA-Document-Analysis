This project was created by Sydney Reuter as part of the George Mason University (GMU) CRIM 515 class, Criminal Justice Research Methods and Data Analysis. The project analyzes 98 research articles authored by members of GMU's Criminology, Law and Society (CLS) program. The primary statistical method used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a machine learning technique, which identifies common topics and themes, as well as network analysis to identify relationships and similarities between topics and authors. Visual outputs include bar charts and word maps, which were visually analyzed to confirm the LDA findings and relationships between common topics.
